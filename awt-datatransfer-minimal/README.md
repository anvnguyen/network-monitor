awt-datatransfer-minimal dependencies
=====================================

WTF, why are there awt classes in an Android project?
-----------------------------------------------------
These dependencies allow us to use the java mail api to send e-mails on Android.

The javax.activation and javax.mail libraries rely on some standard java classes
which are not present in Android. In particular, the following classes are required:
* java.awt.datatransfer.DataFlavor
* java.awt.datatransfer.Transferable
* java.awt.datatransfer.UnsupportedFlavorException 

Another solution: javamail-android
----------------------------------

One solution exists for this problem: the javamail-android library: 
https://code.google.com/p/javamail-android/source/
This library does not seem to be available on maven central or jcenter 
(or any maven repository). If you know of a place where it is hosted, please let me know!

The javamail-android library repackages the above java.awt.datatransfer classes
into an ```additionnal.jar``` file, but in a separate package: ```myjava.awt.datatransfer```.
This is to prevent errors when compiling the code, related to using "java" as a 
top-level package:
```
Ill-advised or mistaken usage of a core class (java.* or javax.*)
  	when not building a core library.
```
Since the classes are moved to myjava.awt.datatransfer, the javax.mail and javax.activation
classes must be modified to use the myjava package.  They are repackaged into
```mail.jar``` and ```activation.jar``` files.

It seems that the javamail-android project has not been updated since 2009.

Configuration
-------------
The approach in this project is different:
* The necessary files from java.awt.datatransfer are included here, in the original java package.
* No customization or repackaging is done for the javax.mail and javax.activation libraries

Since this project includes classes in the top-level java package, an android project depending 
on this project must therefore include some gradle configuration in order to prevent the 
compilation errors about using the java package.  There are two options:

**First option**: add the --core-library argument to dex:
```
android {
    dexOptions {
        preDexLibraries = false
    }
}
project.tasks.withType(com.android.build.gradle.tasks.Dex) {
    additionalParameters=['--core-library']
}
```
Note, this is only needed for a debug configuration. In the release configuration,
these java.awt.datatransfer.* classes will have their package name changed by 
proguard.  

**Second option**: let proguard repackage these classes for both debug and release build types:
```
buildTypes {
    debug {
        minifyEnabled true
        proguardFiles getDefaultProguardFile('proguard-android-optimize.txt'), 'proguard-project.txt', 'proguard-debug.txt'
    }
    release {
        minifyEnabled true
        proguardFiles getDefaultProguardFile('proguard-android-optimize.txt'), 'proguard-project.txt'
    }
}
```
proguard-debug.txt:
```
-dontoptimize
-keep class com.myandroidapp.** {*;}
```

TODO
====
I would like to publish this as a stand-alone library on jcenter at some point.
But for now, this has only been tested with the network monitor app which only
uses some basic functionality for sending e-mails.
